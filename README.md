Logo Rotation Update:
    Ensure you have multiple versions of your logo saved, preferably in different orientations or styles.
    Use CSS animations or JavaScript to create a rotating effect for the logo.
    Test the rotation to ensure it works smoothly and looks visually appealing.
Image Hover Effects:
    Add CSS rules to apply hover effects to images. These effects could include scaling, changing opacity, or adding overlays.
    Test the hover effects across different image types and sizes to ensure consistency.
Color Scheme Modification:
    Update your CSS to reflect the new color scheme you desire. This includes changing text colors, background colors, and border colors as needed.
    Ensure the new color scheme maintains readability and visual appeal.
Contact Form Addition:
    If you don't already have one, integrate a contact form plugin into your website.
    Customize the form fields and styling to match your website's design.
    Test the contact form to ensure submissions are being received correctly.
  "Hellohands" Message:
    Add the "hellohands" message to your website, preferably in a fixed position such as the top left corner.
    Use CSS to style the message, ensuring it stands out but doesn't obstruct other content.
